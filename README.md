Simple fader plugin with mute toggle usable for the MOD Duo from https://www.moddevices.com

Expect many flaws regarding source quality and regarding design. My motivation was to create a simple gate, that can be muted by a button.

This plugin can also be used outside the MOD world, by simply running:
- make
- make install

Have fun and input is always welcome! :D
